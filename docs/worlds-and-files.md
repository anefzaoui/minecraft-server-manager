# Worlds & files

[← Back to docs index](README.md)

## Worlds

The **Worlds** page manages the world data across your servers - swap the active world, upload a world, or download one.

## The file manager

Under a server's **World** section, the **Files** tab is a full in-browser file manager for that server's data directory. List, read, edit, create, rename, move, copy, delete, and upload files - everything you'd normally do over SSH, from the browser.

Text files open in an editor with a 2 MB limit; larger files can be downloaded. Uploads accept multiple files at once.

### Staying inside the sandbox

Every file operation is confined to the server's own data directory. The panel resolves each path and refuses anything that would escape - `..` traversal, absolute paths, and even symlinks that point outside the directory (including dangling ones that don't exist yet). A mod or plugin can't plant a link to trick the file manager into reading or writing elsewhere on the host.

## Mods

For modded servers, the **Mods** tab (also under **World**) manages the mod set - browse and add mods, and see what's installed. Mod and pack updates surface on the [Updates](updates.md) page.
